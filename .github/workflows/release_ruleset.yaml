# Reusable workflow that can be referenced by repositories in their `.github/workflows/release.yaml`.
# See example usage in https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yaml
#
# By default this workflows calls `.github/workflows/release_prep.sh` as the command to prepare
# the release. This can be customized with the `release_prep_command` attribute. Release notes are
# expected to be outputted to stdout from the release prep command.
#
# This workflow uses https://github.com/bazel-contrib/setup-bazel to prepare the cache folders.
# Caching may be disabled by setting `mount_bazel_caches` to false.
